# Can-you-defeat-AI

Pong which can be played in the browser against an artificial agent written in HTML canvas. Play the live demo [here]
(https://abhinavsagar.github.io/Can-you-defeat-AI/).

## TODO

You can extend this project and make something really cool on top of it like adding levels or change the interactions between the agent 
and environment.
