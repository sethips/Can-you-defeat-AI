# Can-you-defeat-AI
This is a simple demonstration of a game which can be played in the browser against an artificial agent. This game is made using HTML canvas.

<p>I think this application is a good example for people are looking forawrd to make games employing machine learning and artificial intelligence. Although all the rules of this game are hand coded but still it gives a fairly good picture of how to get started. You can use this game to proceed in the area of game development with both supervised and unsupervised learning. You can take this learning to programming languages like C# and game engines like unity which are more suited for building games.</p>

<p>You can extend this project and make something really cool on top of it like adding levels.</p>
